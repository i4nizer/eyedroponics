# Smart Hydroponics with NPK Sensor, pH Sensor, and Pest Detection System using CNN Model

This project integrates IoT devices (ESP32 and ESP32-CAM) with a CNN-based pest detection model to create a smart hydroponics system. The system monitors and optimizes plant health using NPK and pH sensors, while providing real-time pest detection to enhance crop yield and sustainability. The backend and frontend enable seamless data visualization and control for users.
